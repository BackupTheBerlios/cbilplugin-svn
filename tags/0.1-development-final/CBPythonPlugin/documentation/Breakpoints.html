<h2>Breakpoints</h2>
Like the GDB debugger plugin, breakpoints are market in the editor as a red dot in the left margin. You can add or remove breakpoints by left clicking on the left margin of any open python source file (this is true whether or not you are currently debugging). If you add or remove lines of text in a file with breakpoints, the plugin will warn you that you could lose synchronization but will not attempt to resynch breakpoints. However, if you stop and restart the debugger, breakpoints will be resynched.<br />

Limitations<ul><li />Temporary and conditional breakpoints are not currently supported</ul>
