<h2>How to Debug Python Script</h2>
<h3>Three methods to start a debug session</h3>
<ol><li />Choose "Start Debug" from the Python menu, this will prompt you with a file dialog<li />Right click in the editor pane of an open python source file and select "Python Debug"<li />Right click on a python source in the project tree and select "Python Debug"<br />
</ol>
<h3>What you should see</h3>
The debugger will start promptly, open and activate the selected file in C::B and show a code position arrow at the first line of code (much like the GDB debugger). Output from the program AND the debugger is routed to the PyDebugger log window (eventually I will do a better job of separating program output from debugger output)<br />
<h3>Debugger Actions:</h3>
You can<ul><li />Continue: By selecting "Continue" from the python menu or clicking the continue button on the python toolbar<li />Move to the next line in the current block: By selecting "Next" from the python menu or clicking the "Next line" python toolbar button<li />Step to the next instruction (even if it is in a subordinate block of code such as a function call): By selecting "Step" from the python menu or clicking the "Step into" button on the python toolber<li />Stop debugging: Select stop on the menu or the toolbar<li />Add/Remove breakpoints: You can add or remove breakpoints by left clicking on the left margin of any open python source file (this is true whether or not you are currently debugging).<li />Watch variables: Select "View Watch" from the python menu. See python debugger watch below<li />Issue commands directly to the debugger and/or your program: Select "Send Command to Debugger" from the python menu<li />(In the future: Step out, Run to cursor, Conditional breakpoints will be supported.)<br />
</ul>
<h3>Known issues:</h3>
<ul><li />Stopping a debug session can be hit or miss. You may need to kill the process (for windows right click on the windows taskbar -&gt; Task Manager -&gt; Processes tab -&gt; scroll to python, select it and click end now.<li />By default, the python debugger enters a post mortem debugger state if there is an uncaught exception. this isn't handled very carefully in the plugin, but you should be able to issue commands to the debugger and possible watch variables in this state.<li />The plugin parses the debugger command prompt "(Pdb) " - if your program produces this as output it will cause unpredictable results (I will exventually change the debugger command prompt to somehing less likely to appear as program output or find a better way of handling program output)<li />The plugin does not echo debbugger command input in the watch<br />
